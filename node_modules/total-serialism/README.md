# Total Serialism

**Visit the [Total Serialism Documentation](http://tmhglnd.github.io/total-serialism) for interactive examples.**

`total-serialism` is a set of methods used for procedurally generating and transforming number sequences. This library is mainly designed with algorithmic composition of music in mind, but can surely be useful for other purposes that involve generation and manipulation of arrays and numbers. The library is a result of my research in algorithmic composition, livecoding and electronic music and was first prototyped with Max/MSP in the [Mercury](http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury) livecoding environment.

*This library is a work in progress. I'm always interested in receiving inspiration, suggestions, enhancements, literature and more. Feel free to file an [issue here](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism/issues) or make a pull request and I will gladly look into it!*

Use the `new TL.Scala()` class to import a *.scl* file (Scala tuning format) to work with custom tuning systems apart from the Western 12-TET (Equal Temperament) tuning or use one of the tunings from a database with over 5000 tunings from [Stichting Huygens-Fokker](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/).

```js
// Create an instance of a Scala class
let scl = new TL.Scala();

scl.scalaToFreq([60, 63, 67, 69, 72, 81, 36, 48]);
//=> [ 261.63, 311.13, 392.00, 440.00, 523.25, 880.00, 65.41, 130.81 ]

// Get the entire list of names from the library
scl.names;
// [ '05-19',
//   '05-22',
//   '05-24',

# Content

The library consists of a few subsets:
- [`Generative`](docs/generative-methods.md) : Basic methods that generate arrays of number sequences, such as methods that generate an ascending array of numbers evenly spread between a low and high value.
- [`Algorithmic`](docs/algorithmic-methods.md) : These are also generative methods, but are in general more complex algorithms, such as euclidean rhythm generation, lindenmayer string expansion, fibonacci sequence, pisano periods and more.
- [`Stochastic`](docs/stochastic-methods.md) : Methods for procedurally generating number sequences based on various types of randomness, such as white noise (evenly distributed), rolling dice, flipping a coin and more. Also includes Markov Chain.
- [`Transform`](docs/transform-methods.md) : Methods that transform the array in some fashion. Think of methods such as reversing, palindrome, duplicating, inversing, interleaving and more.
- [`Statistic`](docs/statistic-methods.md) : A set of methods from Statistics and Probability Theory that allow for analysis of number sequences for statistical purposes. For example getting the average value or the most common value from an array.
- [`Translate`](docs/translate-methods.md) : Translate between different notation systems. For example convert midi values to frequency, or note names to midi integers. Or use a relative semitone notation system and convert to midi. Map values in an Array to a specified scale, and output the relative values in the specified scale, root and octave.
- [`Utility`](docs/utility-methods.md) : Basic arithmetic and methods necessary to run functions in the libraries above. But can also be of help in your own algorithmic processes.

# In Action

The following links redirect to p5.js sketches coded in the p5 browser editor. These sketches demonstrate some of the methods from this library, used in both sound (for algorithmic composing) and visuals. The sketches use the ts.es5.min.js bundled minified version of this package. See [install](#install) for instructions on how to include the minified version in the index.html and script.

- 1. [Simple Melody](https://editor.p5js.org/tmhglnd/sketches/u2RVN7Udt)

A simple synth with a generative melody the notes are generated through chaining of a few methods. Using: `Gen.spreadInclusive(), Mod.duplicate(), Util.add()`

- 2. [Simple Arp](https://editor.p5js.org/tmhglnd/sketches/Q5GpSmArQ)

A simple arpeggiator with a melody generated from multiple periods of a scaled sine function. The period of the function changes over time. using: `Gen.sine()`

- 3. [Euclidean Bass](https://editor.p5js.org/tmhglnd/sketches/oalWyeXp7)

A simple bass synthesizer with a 4 note progression, using euclidean rhythm generators to make a rhythm by adding 2 arrays of euclidean rhythms together. Using: `Algo.euclid(), Util.add()`

- 4. [Hexadecimal Arp](https://editor.p5js.org/tmhglnd/sketches/2aYPOD6Lo)

A arpeggiator that uses a generated melody from multiple periods of a scaled cosine function and plays a rhythm generated by a hexadecimal value. Using: `Algo.hexBeat(), Gen.cosine()`

# Inspiration & Further Reading

This library is inspired by the composition techniques named `Serialism` and `Total Serialism`. The technique approaches the parameters that make up a piece of music as individual series of values. These parameters are (but not limited to) *pitch, duration/rhythm and velocity/dynamic*.

Serialism originated from the `twelve-tone` technique, described in 1919 by Josef Hauer in his published work "Law of the twelve tones". This technique starts out with a randomly ordered set of the twelve chromatic notes. From there on out you can apply transformations on this set, such as reverse/retrograde, inverse, transpose, and combinations between those.

For many of the functions programmed much inspiration was gained from Laurie Spiegels paper on "Manipulation of Musical Patterns" (1981) in which she suggests to *"extract a basic "library" consisting of the most elemental  transformations which have consistently been successfully used on musical patterns, a basic group of "tried-and-true" musical manipulations."*

The euclidean rhythm generator was inspired by the famous paper by Godfried Toussaint and the hexadecimal rhythm generator was inspired by Steven Yi's implementation in the CSound livecoding environment and a workshop given by him during the ICLC 2020 in Limerick.

Inspiration for the sequencing also came from the Live Coding scene and current programming languages available such as Tidal, Extempore, SonicPi and more. In Live Coding the Serialism technique is very common when programming music. In many cases the rhythms, melodies, and other musical expressions are expressed in arrays that are iterated based on the timing of the system.

The inspiration for usage of Integer Sequences came from composers such as Iannis Xenakis, who used the fibonacci formula in his piece *Nomos Alpha* and referred to the technique as *Fibonacci Motion*. Also Xenakis referred to the usuage of set theory for composition as *Symbolic Music*. 

The Hexadecimal rhythm generator was inspired by a workshop by Steven Yi at the International Conference on Live Coding 2020 at the University of Limerick, Ireland.

Some methods from the Transformational and Stochastic library are inspired by objects or functions in the Max/MSP programming environment. Such as the urn, spread and spreadInclusive methods.
